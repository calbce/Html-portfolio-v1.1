                <h3>Chemistry of Coffee</h3>
                <p>Coffee is composed of numerous chemical compounds, each contributing to its unique flavour and aroma. Key compounds include caffeine, chlorogenic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and water.</p>
                <p>Caffeine is the most well-known chemical in coffee, responsible for its stimulating effects. Chlorogenic acids are antioxidants that contribute to coffee's bitterness and astringency. During roasting, these acids degrade, creating new compounds that influence flavour and aroma.</p>

                <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
                <p>Research has shown that coffee consumption can have several health benefits. These include improved cognitive function, reduced risk of certain diseases, and enhanced physical performance.</p>
                <p>Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage. Studies have also suggested that regular coffee drinkers may have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and certain types of cancer. However, moderation is key, as excessive caffeine intake can lead to negative effects such as anxiety and disrupted sleep.</p>

                <h3>Impact of Brewing Methods on Coffee Chemistry</h3>
                <p>Different brewing methods can significantly alter the chemical composition of coffee, affecting its flavour, aroma, and health benefits. For example, espresso extraction involves high pressure and short brewing times, leading to a concentrated beverage with a strong flavour and higher caffeine content per volume.</p>
                <p>In contrast, cold brew coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee in cold water for an extended period. This method produces a smoother, less acidic drink with different chemical profiles compared to hot brewing methods.</p>
