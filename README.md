# Caleb's Portfolio v1.1  

## Overview  
This is version 1.1 of my personal portfolio website. It is a more advanced version compared to v1.0, with the addition of styling, better structure, and the inclusion of several functional pages. This version introduces CSS for layout and design, enhancing the visual appearance and user experience.  

## Structure  

### Pages  
1. **Homepage (`index.html`)**  
   - Introduction to the portfolio and a brief description of myself.  
   - Features links to "About Me," "Contact," and new sections for personal and coursework websites.  
   - Displays various project examples with images, descriptions, and links to live sites or project files.

2. **About Me (`About.html`)**  
   - Contains personal background, education, and areas of expertise, including my current studies and experience in software development.

3. **Contact (`contact.html`)**  
   - Includes my contact details and any relevant information for getting in touch.

4. **Personal Website Section**  
   - A new section linking to my personal website, showcasing my other personal projects.

### Key Features  
- **CSS Styling**: Introduced styles to improve layout, typography, and overall design.  
- **Navigation**: Improved navigation across pages, now with a responsive and styled menu.  
- **Project Showcase**: Added more detailed project descriptions and images.  
- **External Links**: Includes links to project files and live websites, providing a better showcase of my work.

### Styling and Design  
- The portfolio uses a clean, modern design with a simple color scheme.  
- Links are styled with a bisque color, changing to white on hover for better visibility and interaction.  
- Each section (e.g., Coursework Websites, Personal Websites) is clearly defined for better user experience.

## Limitations  
- The design is still evolving, and there are some areas for improvement in responsiveness across all devices.
- While there is basic styling, additional design elements and animations could further enhance the portfolio.

## Future Development  
- Improve responsiveness for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).  
- Add more interactivity with JavaScript, such as form validation or dynamic content.  
- Refine the layout and introduce additional CSS animations for enhanced visual appeal.  
- Expand the content with more detailed descriptions and additional projects.
